# overview and goal

People spend a considerable amount of time on their mobile devices for several activities. However, typing on these devices can be a serious pain. Using predictive text models, SwiftKey builds a smart keyboard that makes it easier for people to type on mobile devices. When someone types, the keyboard suggests few options for what the next word might be.

The goal of capstone project is to build similar predictive text models. This report will cover text data cleaning and exploratory analysis to explain the major features of the data, and then will explain plans for creating a prediction algorithm and Shiny app.

Similar to other data science problems, analysis of text data follows the same steps: data gathering and cleaning, exploratory data analysis, statistical inference, model building, prediction, and developing data product. However, because of the nature of text data which is unstructured, preprocessing steps especially the data cleaning need extra effort to convert the data into a representable forms. One example among these efforts is tokenization. Tokenization is the act of breaking up a sequence of string into pieces such as words, characters, or any other elements 1.
